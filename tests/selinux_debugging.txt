With this extra security comes some restrictions: By default, the SELinux
policy does not allow named to write any master zone database files. Only the
root user may create files in the $ROOTDIR/var/named zone database file
directory (the options { "directory" } option), where $ROOTDIR is set in
/etc/sysconfig/named.

The "named" group must be granted read privelege to these files in order for
named to be enabled to read them. Any file created in the zone database file
directory is automatically assigned the SELinux file context named_zone_t .

By default, SELinux prevents any role from modifying named_zone_t files; this
means that files in the zone database directory cannot be modified by dynamic
DNS (DDNS) updates or zone transfers.

The Red Hat BIND distribution and SELinux policy creates two directories where
named is allowed to create and modify files:

$ROOTDIR/var/named/slaves $ROOTDIR/var/named/data.

By placing files you want named to modify, such as slave or DDNS updateable
zone files and database / statistics dump files in these directories, named
will work normally and no further operator action is required. Files in these
directories are automatically assigned the ’named_cache_t’ file context, which
SELinux allows named to write.

You can enable the named_t domain to write and create named_zone_t files by use
of the SELinux tunable boolean variable "named_write_master_zones", using the
setsebool(8) command or the system-config- security GUI . If you do this, you
must also set the ENABLE_ZONE_WRITE variable in /etc/sysconfig/named to 1 / yes
to set the ownership of files in the $ROOTDIR/var/named directory to
named:named in order for named to be allowed to write them.
